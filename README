This is a WIP compiler for a subset of C targeting the cpu I'm building.
At some point I'll make a repository for the cpu and assembler.
Since I'm not done building it yet, I'll test the compiler on the simulation I have of the cpu in Digital. Once I rewrite the assembler in Haskell (current one is in Python and kinda sucks) I'll add it here.
