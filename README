This is a C compiler targeting the cpu I'm building.
Since I'm not done building it, I'm testing the compiler on the simulation I have of the cpu in Digital. 
At some point I'll make a repository with the cpu schematics.

I wrote the assembler in Python a few years ago and it works but the code is a mess. 
Eventually I'll write a better version in Haskell.
